WordPress starter themes provide a solid foundation for building your own custom WordPress themes. In this article, I share my two Gutenberg-optimized starter themes.

What is a starter theme
A starter theme is a lean WordPress theme with minimal styles and functionality. It often contains simple functionality you use across most projects. It gives you a common starting point for your theme development.

Gutenberg introduces many new features and styling requirements, which I’ve documented in my Developer’s Guide to Gutenberg. These starter themes incorporate all the recommendations listed in those articles.

Both of my starter themes use hooks and filters for customization, on which I’m writing a tutorial right now. Be sure to subscribe to email updates so you’re notified when that article is published.

Genesis Starter Theme
Genesis is a theme framework, a base upon which you build your own custom WordPress theme. It helps you build higher quality themes faster, and is built with a focus on SEO and performance. Here’s more information on Genesis.

EA Genesis Child is my starter theme for building custom Genesis child themes.

Non-Genesis Starter Theme
EA Starter is my other starter theme, which I use when Genesis isn’t a good fit – usually when I’m building a network theme that needs to support its own child themes.

It’s a fork of underscores that I updated to include hooks from Theme Hooks Alliance. It’s structured exactly like my Genesis child theme so I can easily move between the two. The only differences are the hook names (ex: tha_content_top instead of genesis_before_loop ).
